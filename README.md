## Overview

[Cheddar](http://quicklizard99.github.com/cheddar/) is a R package for food-web ecologists. It provides 

* a flexible, well-defined representation of an ecological community together with functions that make data import easy and that detect many commonly-occurring errors
* several high-quality published food-web datasets
* functions for computing and plotting a range of food-web and related statistics
* functions that perform community-level manipulations such as lumping trophic species and reordering predation matrices
* support for collections of communities, allowing investigation into changes in community structure through time, across environmental gradients or resulting from experimental manipulation.
